## Calendar Application
The Calendar Application is a simple console-based application built using Java programming language. It allows users to manage their events, add, remove, and update them, and view all events or events for a specific date. The application provides a basic calendar view and enables users to navigate between months.

The project contains four classes: CalendarManager, Event, UserInterface, and Main.

# CalendarManager
The CalendarManager class is responsible for managing the events in the application. It provides methods to add, remove, update, and retrieve events for a specific date or all events. The events field holds a list of all the events in the calendar. It is implemented using an ArrayList.

# Event
The Event class represents an event in the calendar. It contains three fields: title, startTime, and endTime, which represent the title of the event and its start and end times, respectively. The class provides getter and setter methods for each field and overrides the toString() method to display the event details.

# UserInterface
The UserInterface class is responsible for interacting with the user. It displays a menu of options and performs the corresponding action based on the user's input. The class provides methods to add, remove, update, and view events for a specific date or all events. The start() method displays the calendar view and the menu of options and handles the user's input.

# Main
The Main class is the entry point of the application. It creates an instance of the CalendarManager class and an instance of the UserInterface class and starts the user interface.

# How to run the application
To run the application, compile all the Java files and run the Main class. The UserInterface class will display the calendar view and the menu of options. Follow the prompts to manage your events.

# Conclusion
The Calendar Application is a simple but useful application that demonstrates the use of Java programming language to create a console-based application. It provides basic functionality to manage events and view a calendar. With some enhancements, it can be further developed into a full-featured calendar application.
